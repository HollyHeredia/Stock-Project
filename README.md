# VBA-Homework
This repository contains the solutions to the VBA challenge (The VBA of Wallstreet). This challenge is based off an excel spreadsheet provided by my data analytics bootcamp. The challenge was to find the yearly percent change of each stock, highlight positive changes in green and negative changes in red, and to total each stock.

This repository contains a screenshot for each sheet in the Excel workbook after the code is run. Columns to list each ticker, yearly change, percent change, and total volumn of the stock have been added from the original spreadsheet. The Yearly Change column has content in Red if it is negative and Green if postivie. I have added a % sign to the % change column.

I have saved the code in a seperate format unattached to the spreadsheet that should be easy to open. This code is notated to make it easier to understand what each function is doing.
